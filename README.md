# Deciphering Tunic

----

<em><strong>Spoiler warning:</strong> While this post doesn't explicitly contain any spoilers, it
reveals several pages of the instruction manual, which could be considered light
spoilers if you want to experience the game fully for yourself.</em>

----

I bought [Tunic](https://tunicgame.com/) a while ago when it was on special and
I finally got around to playing it last week.

A core mechanic of the game is that the game doesn't explicitly teach you how to
play. Instead, you discover pages of the "instruction manual" as you play which
lets you progressively figure out the more advanced mechanics of the game. The
catch? The instruction manual only has a small number of English words! Most of
the manual is written in a unique script created by the game designers.

</p>

Don't let that scare you though! The developers don't intend for you to read the
script. The idea was to evoke that feeling of picking up a game as a kid and not
being able to fully understand how it works, but giving just enough information
for you to figure out the game for yourself. If you ever played classic games
like Zelda, you'll know what I mean.

## But is it really text?

At first, I didn't pay too much attention to the script. A quick skim gives the
impression that it could plausibly be text, but there's no reason not to think
that they were simply writing-like scribbles to give flavour to the game. There
is enough variation in the glyphs that would mean it's unlikely to be an
alphabetic system (like, for example, the hidden message in the *Artemis Fowl*
books where each symbol corresponds to a different letter). And I'd just started
a new game! I had adventuring to do!

But soon enough, the mystery got the better of me and I decided to give it a
shot.

## Starting assumptions

Where do you start with something like this where you have no information
whatsoever? Essentially, you make some basic assumptions, try to make educated
guesses, and then you cross-check your guesses with other text and see if those
guesses hold.

I assumed:

* The text is English.
* Given the amount of glyphs, the system is some kind of
  [syllabary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllabary) based on [English
  phonemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_phonology#Phonemes), not
  letters.
* Each group of symbols connected by the centre line denotes a word.

## Making educated guesses

With that in mind, I skimmed through the manual looking for text next to
pictures that would give a hint to its meaning. This text caught my eye:

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/lost.png"/>
</p>

Page 28 was a map of one of the main areas of the game. For whatever reason, I
thought there was a chance that this text reads, **LOST? SEE p.28**. I quickly
jotted down in my notebook my first guesses:

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/lost-see.png"/>
</p>

At this point, I had no idea *how* those glyphs mapped to those sounds, but this
was a good starting point. My next target was the heading on this page:

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/page-12.jpg"/>
</p>

A very natural guess for this word is, of course, **CONTROLS**. There was no way
to validate this, but with a close look I saw that this could plausibly line up
with my previous guess:

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/controls.png"/>
<br/>
<small><em>Aside: I think I got slightly lucky here, because I only noticed
later that the final character here is NOT the same glyph as the
<strong>S</strong> - it's flipped, because it's actually a
<strong>Z</strong>.</em></small>
</p>

Next, I looked at the text next to the shield, which has the potential **L**
glyph in the middle.

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/shield2.png"/>
</p>

I initially thought this might be the word **BLOCK**, but it didn't feel right.
It was a wild guess, but I pencilled in **SHIELD** for this word instead (which
eventually turned out to be right), giving me a potential glyph for **D**:

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/shield.png"/>
</p>

Then, I tackled the page explaining the space button, in particular the two
actions on the right, which I had plenty of experience doing from playing the
game:

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/page-13.jpg"/>
</p>

I knew pressing space would do a dive roll, and I knew holding space would let
me run. Given that, my guesses here were **ROLL** and **RUN** respectively:

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/roll-run.png"/>
</p>

By this point, I was relatively confident that I was on the right track. This
deduction corresponds perfectly with the guesses for **N** and **ROL** in
**CONTROLS**. I still didn't have a complete understanding of the system, but I
decided it was time to give translating a major piece of text a go.

Where else but the first page to start? I went back and scribbled down a gloss
for the first couple of words:

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/a-secret-legend.png"/>
</p>

That was enough for a big guess: the second and third words were probably
**SECRET** and **LEGEND**. This added to my set of glyphs:

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/more-glyphs.png"/>
</p>

## Consonants and vowels

Now that I had accumulated a set of glyphs that I was relatively certain about,
I felt that one of my initial assumptions was not quite correct. I had started
by assuming the script was a syllabary. The symbols are clearly syllables since
it fits so well, but by this point I felt that there was enough evidence to
think that the syllables could be further deconstructed into consonants and
vowels.

Notice the similarities in these glyphs:

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/comparison.png"/>
<br/>
<small><em>Note: some of these transcriptions aren't correct and still needed
refinement, but they were what I had to work with at this stage.</em></small>
</p>

In particular, assuming the above was true, **LE** and **JE** could give the following
deduction for the consonant **J**:

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/le-je.png"/>
</p>

This felt reasonable and turns out to be correct. Once you discover this
principal, the rest of the script becomes very straightforward (but a little
time-consuming) to decipher. This is left as an exercise for the reader :)

## Phonemes vs. letters

A crucial concept of this script is that it uses not the regular spelling but
the phonetic pronunciation of a word as the basis of its spelling.

For example, take the words **BAIT** and **BITE**. Although **BAIT** is *spelt* with "ai",
it's pronounced **EI** as in the word **BAY**. And while **BITE** is spelt "ite", it's this
word that actually has the vowel **AI**, leading to the following spellings:

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/bait-bite.png"/>
</p>

On the other hand, this means words spelt differently in regular spelling but
have the same pronunciation end up being spelt the same in the game:

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/meat-meet-mete.png"/>
</p>

## The last piece of the puzzle

The script sometimes includes a small circle under some glyphs. I don't think it
would have taken much to figure out what it means even without any clues, but I
was tipped off by this hint on page 21:

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/page-21.jpg"/>
</p>

In fact, it was this clue they motivated me to try to decipher the script in the
first place, since it implied that there was something more to it than just
flavour.

Without the dot, this speech bubble would have read **MY STUCK**, which doesn't
make sense:

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/my-stuck.png"/>
</p>

The clue implies that some kind of swapping needs to occur. This quickly
resolves itself once you try swapping the phonemes of the dotted glyph around:

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/im-stuck.png"/>
</p>

giving the correct reading **I'M STUCK**. In other words, in regular script, the
consonant always comes first, but with the dot, the vowel comes first. This
gives words like **ITEM**, which is correctly written

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/item.png"/>
</p>

instead of the incorrect

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/item-wrong.png"/>
<br/>
<small><em>This is the wrong spelling.</em></small>
</p>

## Do you speak North American?

A phonetic script for English has interesting consequences because of how many
varieties there are. It forces you to pronounce words a particular way, which
may or may not be how you pronounce it in your own accent.

For example, many native speakers will use two different pronunciations of the
word **THE** depending on whether the word that follows it begins with a consonant:
"the" (/ðə/) banana but "thee" (/ði:/) apple. The designers chose to enforce
this difference:

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/the-thee-runes.png"/>
</p>

which you can see in sentences like this one:

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/the-thee.png"/>
<br/>
<small><em>Inscription reads, "<strong>THEE</strong> (/ði:/) heir hungers for
reminders of <strong>THE</strong> (/ðə/) corporeal world."</em></small>
</p>

As a native speaker of New Zealand English, one thing that stands out to me is
that there is only one symbol for both the LOT and THOUGHT vowels (in other
words, the [cot-caught
merger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cot%E2%80%93caught_merger) is required by
the script):

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/cot-caught.png"/>
</p>

I (and probably Australian and UK speakers in general) pronounce these words
**COT** /kɔt/ and **CAUGHT** /ko:t/ respectively, but there is no glyph
available for the /o:/ sound.

A further quirk is that the designers seem to be inconsistent with their
spelling of schwa (/ə/). Generally, they seem to use both the STRUT vowel (/ʌ/)
and the KIT vowel (/ɪ/) for the schwa (and sometimes even /ɛ/, as in **LEGEND**
and **ITEM**). I'm curious to know why they didn't add a glyph specifically for
the schwa given how commonly it shows up in English, but it means that we see
words like **CONTROL** /kəntroʊl/ spelt /kʌtroʊl/ but **BUTTON** /bʌtən/ spelt
/bʌtɪn/.

Personally, as a Kiwi English speaker, I'd always prefer the KIT vowel (see the
choice of spelling for the [nek minnit
meme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLphoP6APkg)), but perhaps North American
speakers lean closer to the STRUT vowel?

## Side quest complete!

In short - I love this script! It's a unique idea, it gives a special flavour to
the feel of the entire game and it makes a great side quest when you want a
break from adventuring.

The design might have been partially influenced by the [Shavian
alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shavian_alphabet) where voiced-unvoiced
consonant pairs are also flipped versions of each other (though in the game
script they are vertically flipped, whereas in the Shavian alphabet they're
rotated 180º). This means you could make a good educated guess for glyphs when
you're deciphering them. For example, once I had /ʒ/ from **TREASURE** I could
pencil the flipped glyph as a guess for /ʃ/ - though the designers chose not to
mirror **H** and **NG** like Shaw does in his alphabet.

I also love how the designers chose to style the writing by separately
connecting the top and bottom parts, obfuscating how the letters work and makes
deciphering the script that much more fun. Consider the word button from the
heading of page 13:

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/button.png"/>
</p>

The border implies that the top and bottom parts are somehow separate, when the
glyphs are actually split like this:

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/button-split.png"/>
</p>

An extreme example of this is the logo of the game, where they fully separate
the top and bottom parts of the phrase **SECRET LEGEND** by inserting the
English word TUNIC in-between the top and bottom parts!

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/title.png"/>
</p>

This was an amazingly fun side quest and now I feel like I have a superpower!
With that, time to get back to adventuring :D
